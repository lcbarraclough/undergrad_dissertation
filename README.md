# Undergrad_dissertation: Investigating the relationship between stand age and ground-dwelling invertebrate communities
Aims:
  1. To measure the age and spread of trees in three forest stands felled at 10 year intervals.
  2. To use pitfall traps to investigate composition of ground dwelling invertebrate communities. 
  3. To use PMDS analysis to determine whether there is distinction between the three communities investigated.
  4. To analyse the spread of tree data and see if there is some relationship between tree community structure and invertebrate community structure.
  5. To discuss the implications this has for forest management and rewilding projects.
